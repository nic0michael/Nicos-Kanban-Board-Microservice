* Another feature is the ability to Split Tasks into Subtasks.
* This application displays two Kanban boards One at the Task level the other at the Subtask level.
* This features the Spring Security Framework with A database for Authentication and Authorization.
  
**Your Work flow is as follows:**  

 1. You Create Customers.
 2. Then create Epics each with its customer assigned to it.
 3. Create and assign User-stories to the Epics.
 4. Create and assign Tasks to the User-stories.
