Specifically the : The GNU General Public License, version 3 or any later version

**In the preamble of the GPL License version 3 It states:**
"By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users."

**In the Basic Permissions it states :**
"All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable
provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program."

**In the section : Conveying Modified Source Versions It states:**
"You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source
code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way,
but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of
the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate."
